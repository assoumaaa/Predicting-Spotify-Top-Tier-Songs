# Predicting-Spotify-Top-Tier-Songs
NOTE: Visuals can be used to show

Introduction:
- We are using data set provided from Kaggle to analyze Spotify songs with respect to their features and genres. This is analyzed through multiple steps as seen below.


In our project, our assignments are split into these 4.
```
- Variable Analysis and Visualizations
- Visualizations of Aggregated Forms Based on Features
- Analysis of the Most Popular Artists and Songs
- How Songs of Different Genres Change Over Time
```

We start of by looking at the correlation between continuous variables, we began by showing a correlation table and then a correlation heatmap.After that we had our focus on anaylzing the most popular artists and song according to several features such as frequency 


## Hypothesis Testing

### Feature Variation with Decade of Release (Era)

Statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different eras of rock music.

**Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: No significant difference in features exist between rock songs released in different eras.

**Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)**: significant difference in features exist between rock songs released in different eras.

**Significance level($Î±$)**: We will be using a significance level of 0.05.

We chose to use rock music for our analysis because of its high frequency in our dataset, which gives us a large sample size allowing for the best distribution of data.

We will be looking at 1960, 1980 and 2000 era rock, 

 `decades were gotten from the random decade program written above, future reruns of program might lead to different values, hence cell was converted to comment `
