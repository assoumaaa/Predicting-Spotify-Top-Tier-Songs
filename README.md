# Predicting-Spotify-Top-Tier-Songs
NOTE: Visuals can be used to show

## Introduction:
- We are using data set provided from Kaggle to analyze Spotify songs with respect to their features and genres. This is analyzed through multiple steps as seen below.


In our project, our assignments are split into these 4.
```
- Variable Analysis and Visualizations
- Visualizations of Aggregated Forms Based on Features
- Analysis of the Most Popular Artists and Songs
- How Songs of Different Genres Change Over Time
```

We start of by looking at the correlation between continuous variables, we began by showing a correlation table and then a correlation heatmap.After that we had our focus on anaylzing the most popular artists and song according to several features such as frequency 


## Hypothesis Testing

### Feature Variation with Decade of Release (Era)

Statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different eras of rock music.

**Null Hypothesis: No significant difference in features exist between rock songs released in different eras.

**Alternative Hypothesis: significant difference in features exist between rock songs released in different eras.

**Significance level: We will be using a significance level of 0.05.

We created a sample dataset of size 1000, to ensure it was large enough to be an accurate representation of the data while also remaining small enough that the scatterplot were not just cluttered.

Just as a safeguard we ran ANOVA between our sample dataset and the main dataframe to see if there were any significant differences in mean.
